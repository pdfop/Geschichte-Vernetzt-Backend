        This is the return type for calls that may return any type of checkpoint. The inheritance between Checkpoint
        and its subclasses in mongoengine is not transferred to the Graphene Fields defined here so Field type
        represents this inheritance. It is queried by splitting the result on type like any union. e.g.
        checkpoint{

            {
                id
